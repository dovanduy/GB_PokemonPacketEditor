# BGB PokemonPacketEditor
## What is this ?
This software has the goal of linking to your BGB emulator and do stuff in fights, like play versus an ArtificialInteligence, or Monitor packets, or Randomize packets etc...
## Ok, Great, How do I get it ?
For now, you have to clone it, compile it (Visual Studio works fine), run it, and finally use "Connect" on BGB to 127.0.0.1
## Wow, I like it, but I found a bug
Report it on the "Issues" tab
## WOW, I love it so much I want to add/fix stuff
